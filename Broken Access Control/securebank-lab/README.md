## üéØ Lab Challenges

### Challenge 1: Horizontal Privilege Escalation

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Beginner)

**Scenario:**  
You are logged in as a regular user but want to access other users' account information.

**Questions to Answer:**

- Can you access another user's account details without their credentials?
- What URL parameter controls which user's data is displayed?
- How would you systematically enumerate all user accounts?
- What sensitive information can you extract from other users' profiles?

**Learning Goals:**

- Understanding IDOR vulnerabilities
- Parameter manipulation techniques
- Data enumeration methods

---

### Challenge 2: Vertical Privilege Escalation

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)

**Scenario:**  
As a regular user, you've discovered an admin panel but are denied access. Find ways to bypass the authorization checks.

**Questions to Answer:**

- What HTTP response code do you receive when accessing the admin panel?
- Can you identify any HTTP headers that might bypass the restriction?
- Are there any URL parameters that could override the access control?
- What administrative functions become available after successful bypass?

**Learning Goals:**

- Authorization bypass techniques
- HTTP header manipulation
- Admin panel exploitation

---

### Challenge 3: Transaction IDOR Vulnerability

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Beginner-Intermediate)

**Scenario:**  
The banking system allows users to view transaction details, but the implementation may have flaws.

**Questions to Answer:**

- How are transaction IDs structured in the application?
- Can you view transactions that don't belong to your account?
- What happens when you try sequential transaction IDs?
- Are there any hidden or sensitive transactions you can discover?

**Learning Goals:**

- Sequential ID enumeration
- Transaction data exposure
- Business logic flaws

---

### Challenge 4: API Access Control Bypass

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)

**Scenario:**  
The application has API endpoints that may not properly validate user permissions.
`/api/user-data.php`

**Questions to Answer:**

- What API endpoints are available in the application?
- Do the APIs properly validate user authentication?
- Can you access admin-only API functions as a regular user?
- What sensitive data can be extracted through API calls?

**Learning Goals:**

- API security testing
- Authentication bypass in APIs
- Data extraction techniques

---

### Challenge 5: Session Management Vulnerabilities

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (Advanced)

**Scenario:**  
Investigate how the application manages user sessions and look for weaknesses.

**Questions to Answer:**

- How are session tokens generated and validated?
- Can you predict or forge session tokens?
- Is there a way to hijack another user's session?
- How does the application handle session expiration?

**Learning Goals:**

- Session token analysis
- Session hijacking techniques
- Predictable token generation flaws

---

### Challenge 6: Password Reset Vulnerability

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)

**Scenario:**  
The application has a password reset feature that may have security flaws. `/api/reset-password.php`

**Questions to Answer:**

- What parameters are required for password reset requests?
- Can you reset another user's password without proper authorization?
- How are password reset tokens generated and validated?
- Is there any rate limiting on password reset attempts?

**Learning Goals:**

- Password reset flow analysis
- Authorization bypass in sensitive functions
- Token security assessment
